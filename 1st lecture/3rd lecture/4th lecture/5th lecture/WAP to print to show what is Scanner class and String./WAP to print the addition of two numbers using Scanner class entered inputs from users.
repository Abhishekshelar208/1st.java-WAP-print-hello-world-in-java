    System.out.println("The sum is:"+sum);    //printing the result.

    System.out.println("Enter a number to check entered number is Integer number or not!"); //getting a input from user to check entered value is Integer or not.
    boolean wow=s.hasNextInt();       //hasnextInt() --> it is used to check entered value is Integer or not if yes then print true or if no then print false.
    System.out.println(wow);  //print ture or false according your entered data.

    //both part 1 and part 2 are not executed at same time you have to execute them seprately.

    //this is part 2

    System.out.println("Enter String:");  //getting String from user through keyboard.
    String str=s.nextLine(); //nextLine() --> it is used to get all data from user including characters,numbers and special symbols.
    System.out.println("The String is:");
